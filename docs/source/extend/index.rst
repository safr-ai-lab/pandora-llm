Building with Pandora
=====================

``pandora_llm`` provides a unified open framework for sharing and testing privacy attacks on LLMs.

Our philosophy is to make extending and contributing to ``pandora_llm`` easy by minimizing the effort needed to test a new attack.

In this section, you will learn how to add your own attacks, models, data, and metrics.
